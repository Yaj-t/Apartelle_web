# Things I updated

For Users:

- Changed the Filtering to Checkbox

For Admins:

- Made the the Room admins into two buttons, manage room types and manage rooms
- Changed the style of managing all rooms for selecting to input type checkbox
- Fixed the bugs of the Rooms section (navigation and search bars)
- Removed the filter buttons in the Rooms Section, making the table headers as the filter buttons

# What to Fix

For User:

- When a user logs in, the "Book Now" button should be transformed to something else
- Contents of the UpdateProfile
- The filter button for the All Rooms should be focused to avoid confusion
- All Rooms filter "Price" can be ascending or descending
- The Edit Forms
