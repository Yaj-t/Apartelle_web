# Things I updated

- Fixed the horizontal scrollbar
- Put a next and back icons in the "Top Rated Rooms" Section but no functions so far
- put "*" after the labels in the Sign-Up page for the required inputs

# What to Fix

- The List of Rooms should only show the rooms with next and back icons
- When the admin logs in, it directly goes to the admin dashboard
- When the link hovers, an animation must occur and make it that it is focused
- When a user logs in, the "Book Now" button should be transformed to something else
